I will maintain a priority queue of size 10 and will insert the first 10 elements in the queue. After that, I will iterate through the numbers, if I find any number larger than the head of priority queue, I will swap them.
  This method is better than sorting all the elements either in descending or ascending numbers to look for the largest 10 numbers.
    Thank You.
